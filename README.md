First Interactive Web Design

This quiz shows my ability to put together an app that takes a user 
through a series of questions with multiple choice answers to select from.
Depending on the answer selected the user will be told if they are correct 
or incorrect.  It will also keep a score and question number updated throughout
the quiz.  At the end it will add up the scores and if the user scores 4/5
or higher they will be given a congratulations message.  If the score is
less than that they will be told to try again.  It will have a restart
button to take the user back the start page to start the quiz again.
